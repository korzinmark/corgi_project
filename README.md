# corgi_project
This project I was made at the end of 2021. This is a pretty simple landing page website dedicated to my friend's dog.  
On this website, with the help of native JS and some JS libraries, the following was done:  
* a hamburger menu for mobile versions 
* a slider for the gallery [(slick-slider library)](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)
* form validation before sending [(jquery validation plugin)](https://jqueryvalidation.org/)
* smooth scroll up arrow
* closing the modal window 
* form sending
